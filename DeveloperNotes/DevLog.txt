Hello! This is the final version of the Blackjack program that has gone through three generations
(at least on the backend). I will likely update this more personally, but this will be the one submitted for
a grade on 11/28/2022.

The other two programs I won't include here they are broken beyond repair but this final product
seems to be what we were looking for in the code and what we'll be working off of from now going forward.

Start of Version 3.0 of the Blackjack program: (10-Hour Session)

    - Implementations of Davidlopez3's GUI in the form of FXML to Controllers (David's contribution)
        - This was done specifically to make this monster code have more manageable scene transitions,
          because this is significantly larger than anything we've worked on in the past.
        - FXML is particularly useful in that it pairs well with 3rd-party visual applications
          such as SceneBuilder which we used heavily in the creation of the GUI elements
        - Soon to be scrapped SceneBuilder table by Sam (Scene1.fxml), Davidlopez3 is working on
          this FXML file

    - Imported CardsFinished as a resource file separate from the src directory (David's contribution)
        - This contains all 52 cards of the deck that are called by test.Cards class to be used in
          every ImageView object in the program
        - Updates to card H12, H13, D12, and D13

    - Complete conversion of Swing source to JavaFX format (Sam's contribution)
        - The base of the scrapped version 2.0 of this program has been completely overhauled
          and converted from its Swing source to a JavaFX format
        - This was done to save time and has its own unique contributions within this program
          in the form of betting and additional official Blackjack rules

    - Integration of back-end into the front-end (Sam's contribution)
        - Along with the conversion to JavaFX included the near complete integration of FXML into
          these back-end classes: test.Cards and test.Game
        - LAMBDA expressions integrated into the test.Game class to deal with button inputs going into
          the application package
        - Calls for all test.Cards Image objects to be integrated into the application package's many ImageView objects

Continued development on FXML files, etc.: (6-Hour Session)

    - Table.fxml updated, Title.fxml created based on current main method for easier UIController calls
      created by Davidlopez3 (currently in the repo) (David's contribution)
        - Insane amounts of recursive calls that ended up breaking the program led to this decision
          (and no they weren't on purpose, Java saved me from breaking my Macbook)
        - This logistically makes more sense since the UIController would deal with both scenes and
          launch the program
        - New Table.fxml almost completely integrated into the Game class

    - Implemented Bets class to externally handle the chunky code for the Game class (Sam's contribution)
        - It's so pretty and simple :) (besides the method with 5 boolean calls)
        - Still needs more Game class and UIController integration

    - Further flushed out the Game class (Sam's contribution)
        - Should have all necessary JavaFX calls, double check on debugging
        - There's a comedic System.exit(0) on line 365 btw
        - All ui controls are correctly reassigned according to UIController updates
