Notes for the Java Blackjack game
(had to rethink the code from the ground up for JavaFX since I wasn't understanding
what exactly would go into it; I have a better reference now)

Rules:
Standard deck is 52, most casinos use 6 decks = 312
    Deck class for multiple deck usages?
Get as close to 21 or 21 as possible without going over 21


Bet in chips min and max pre-established most likely $2-$500
        One card given face up clockwise, second card face up,
        dealers second card is face down


Naturals are given 1.5x the bet immediately (natural being 21 at the start)
"Stand"(no card) "Hit"(another card)"Bust"(over 21)


Splitting Pairs:
    If the players first two cards are the same denomination (2 jacks, 2 sixes)
    Both cards are given the original bet
    (if the original bet is $20 then that is
    $20 on one deck and $20 on another = $40 total)


Doubling Down:
    When the two cards dealt total 9, 10, 11 the bet can be doubled and
    a third card is given face down and revealed after all bets are settled
    at the end of the hand


Settlement:
    The players bets all go first if the players bust they have lost
    if the dealer busts the dealer pays out the bets,
    if under 21 they pay to every player higher than the dealer,
    if 21 they collect from every player except if someone has 21 then its a
    tie and no chips are paid or collected at all (I think?)

Reshuffle:
    Insert card indicates the time for a reshuffle (idk when this is lol)


    This game will allow card counting because I like the idea of it
    Code needs to be semi-predictable

    CARD VALUES
    (SUITS DON'T APPLY TO VALUES)
    ACE: 1 OR 11
    NUMBERS: NUMBER VALUE
    FACE CARDS: 10
